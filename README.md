> ***Overview and Origin***

WorkFusion is a company founded by Max Yankelevich and Andrew Volkov in 2010 and it’s been established in New York. Through their common interest and experience in the AI field, they conducted and sponsored research on the subject at MIT and as a result, WorkFusion was born. Ever since its creation, the company has had 7 rounds of funding, for a total amount of 341.7M USD. Seed capital was raised one year after its creation for the amount of 2.3M USD and last round of funding was conducted in March 2021, raising 220M USD. 

> ***Business Activities***

According to the company, its mission is to “accelerate the world’s transition to more meaningful work”. Their expertise revolves around creating automated solutions leveraging machine learning and digital bots for enterprises in numerous industries, allowing them to deploy workforce towards more strategic work while contributing to cost reduction and process efficiencies. According to Andrew Volkov, one of its founders its key to success has been to develop tools that are applicable for enterprises from the get go as opposed to having to spend too much time designing specific tools for each client, preventing them from realizing benefits earlier in implementation. This means, client operations are developed in platforms already existing and clients are trained on them and start developing some of its operations on these models. This is crucial, as the tools developed by WorkFusion allow clients to notice the benefits in record time – from months to weeks. 

Throughout its operations and rapid growth in the last ten years, the company has become a leader in the automation and machine learning field and has an extensive portfolio of customers from different industries and geographies. The company has implemented a B2B model of service in which its focused in servicing business as opposed to serve end consumers. This has helped WorkFusion to develop and leverage models that are easily applicable to clients in different industries, so they can digitalize operations in fields as diverse as banks, retail, financial institutions and health care providers. 

Another key differentiation factor has been the clear prioritization of having access to good, consistent data so machines learn processes and create algorithms from a best practice approach. This has been possible for WorkFusion by implementing crowdsourcing model, through which they are able to collaborate with experts on each subject at hand to develop AI models and train digital bots. This approach has led WorkFusion to leverage what they call the “freelance economy” in which they collaborate with subject matter experts while managing their fixed costs, allowing them to operate in a more agile, flexible and client-oriented manner and also permitting for the company to develop models with different levels of complexity and for such variety of industries as mentioned above.  

Workfusion has been using and developing technology in machine learning, optical character recognition, natural language processing, robot process automation and business process management technologies.

> ***Landscape***

WorkFusion plays in Enterprise Solution space through automation services. 

In this domain, developments such as RPAs, machine learning and chatbots have been the main disruptors in the last couple of years. One of the main characteristics of these developments is that are applicable to a wide number of industries and looks to solve problems almost all organization have: unlock efficiencies and make better use of their human resource. 
Some on WorkFusion main competiros are Automation Anywhere, UiPath and BluePrism Cloud

> ***Results***

WorkFusion has had a major impact on customers by allowing them to re-deploy and better use their human resource. By automating time consuming tasks, employees are now turned to value crating activities for their companies. Having employees stepping away from repetitive tasks have open a number of possibilities in terms of creativity and on upskilling talent within the organizations. In the case of BMO Financial Group, tools developed by WorkFusion in AI and ML have led to improve compliance on their processes, to spot and reduce fraud and improve customer experience. 

As noted earlier, a model is as successful as it is useful for the client. This is why WorkFusion approach to reduce as much as possible timing of implementation has resulted as key in its success. Being able to experience real benefits in terms of process efficiency, reduction of repetitive tasks and room for human error in a period as short as 4 to 8 weeks 

> ***Recomendation***

As technology advances, it is perceived as a threat to workforce as this field of FinTech has only possibilities to keep expanding and finding more fields where it can be useful and efficient. This is why is crucial to make sure people gets qualified and equipped with skills in order to take advantage of this revolution. WorkFusion could implement a workstream in which training is provided to different professionals interested in the field, that have relevant experience in subjects the company could potentially expand its automation services. This way WorkFusion gets the collaboration needed to build systems with excellent data quality and people are being trained on an adjacent complement of their carrers. 

Technologies such as speech recognition, image recognition could become important in this field as automation expands into other industries where there’s more human judgement used now. This will drive the industry to go from a robotic automation to and intelligent automation, where more complex data is used and solutions can evolve from speeding up processes to contributing to improve complex decision- making processes.
